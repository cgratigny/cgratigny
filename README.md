#### Hi, I'm Chris. I'm a Ruby on Rails Developer

As a seasoned Ruby on Rails developer with over 10 years of experience, I have developed a deep appreciation for the Rails ecosystem's convention over configuration philosophy. 

Stack Breakdown of my recent work:
- Ruby on Rails: Extensive experience starting from Rails 3x to the current Rails 7.1.2.
- Sidekiq: Utilized for efficient background processing in a multi-tenant environment.
- JavaScript (jQuery + Stimulus): Transitioned from jQuery to Stimulus, leveraging Turbo and Hotwire for enhanced performance.
- Git & GitHub: Proficient in version control and repository management, including GitHub actions and deployments.
- PostgreSQL: Skilled in optimizing queries for speed and designing efficient data structures.
- Memcached & MongoDB: Experienced in using Memcached for caching solutions and MongoDB for NoSQL use cases.
- Third-Party Integrations: Integrated various third-party services including Stripe, Braintree, Authorize.net, Hubspot, Zoom, Twilio, Sendgrid, and more.
- Digital Ocean: Competent in managing servers and using Digital Ocean cloud, supplemented with Hatchbox.io and other third-party solutions.
- Rspec: Primary automated testing tool.
- Multi-Tenant Architecture: Specialized in schema-based multitenancy, a unique and complex aspect of software development.
- CSS: Proficient with Bootstrap for years, currently transitioning to Tailwind for its compatibility with Rails. While my focus backend, I have an eye for detail on the front-end
